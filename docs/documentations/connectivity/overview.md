# Overview

## Introduction

Our platform offers two robust connectivity methods for seamless integration and efficient data exchange with our services: API (Application Programming Interface) and SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol). These methods are designed to cater to different integration preferences and enable secure and reliable communication between your system and Fundnode platform.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An Application Programming Interface (API) serves as a uniform method of interaction between two applications, serving as an entry point into a software program. 
By doing so, it permits other programs to interact with it without requiring developers to divulge the complete underlying code.

In a broader sense, APIs offer an abstraction layer of communication, granting effortless and immediate access to data stored in any location for any data consumer.

Fundnode API connectivity method provides a direct and efficient way for seamless integration between your system and our financial platform. 
Through the API, you can securely interact with our services, submit subscription/redemption orders, retrieve transaction status, and access essential information in real-time. 
This integration method offers enhanced control and flexibility, enabling you to manage order activities promptly and accurately.
By leveraging our API, you can streamline your processes, and optimize data exchange.

### SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
For participants who prefer a batch-oriented data exchange process, our SFTP service offers a secure and efficient solution. 
You can securely transfer files containing order-related data to and from our system. 
This method is ideal for bulk data processing and is suited for scenarios where real-time interactions are not necessary.

Choose the connectivity method that best aligns with your business requirements and enjoy seamless integration experience with Fundnode platform.
