# Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

## Introduction
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) proves highly advantageous when addressing the following requirements:
- Management of share/unit holder registers.
- Handling investors' transactions, such as commitments/subscriptions, capital calls, redemptions, exchanges, transfers, and distributions/dividends.
- Efficient reconciliation processes.

Fundnode harnesses the potential of distributed ledgers to create a collaborative infrastructure, streamlining the management of investor ownership details, automating transaction processing, and optimizing business workflows. 
Notably, DLT eradicates the conventional distinction between trading and post-trading phases, combining them seamlessly with automatic execution based on pre-defined conditions.
The primary focus is on achieving utmost efficiency and automation while managing a substantial number of investors.

## Why Distributed Ledger Technologies
Distributed Ledger Technologies offer a mechanism for instantaneously synchronizing a centralized registry or database of information.
This synchronization is made possible by the decentralized nature of the blockchain, which ensures that entries are cryptographically secured, verified immutably, and mutually agreed upon.
Transactions are subjected to validation and organization into blocks on the blockchain, leading to the creation of new blocks once the previous ones are filled. By adopting blockchain,
organizations can establish trust through independent validation within a tamper-resistant, peer-distributed ledger, eliminating the need for offline reconciliation processes.

## Benefits of DLT
### Swift and real-time transaction processing:
- Transaction are rapidly executed from one peer to another.
- Ledgers are automatically and instantaneously updated.
- Simultaneous execution of transactions on both ends.
- Private ledgers exhibit higher performance compared to public ones.

### Cost-effective
- Transaction validation relies on economical computing power rather than traditional labor expenses.
- Reduced reliance on intermediaries, lowering costs associated with additional services.
- Elimination of reconciliation work due to the streamlined and automated nature of the process.

### Transparent and auditable
- Blockchain operates as an open-source technology, promoting transparency and accessibility.
- All transactions are visible and traceable within the ledger, maintaining privacy while providing a comprehensive audit trail.
- Accounts are made visible on an anonymous basis, ensuring confidentiality while allowing for necessary scrutiny.

### Dependable
- Blockchain technology demonstrates resilience, devoid of any single point of failure.
- Transactions processed within the blockchain are immutable and irrevocable, ensuring a high level of reliability and trustworthiness.
