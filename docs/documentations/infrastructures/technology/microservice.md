# Microservice

## Introduction
>â€œMicroservices are a collection of decentralized, loosely connected software services that perform a limited set of precisely defined tasks."

- In software development, the application's logic is fragmented into **small, distinct components**.These components have precise boundaries and well-defined responsibilities, 
  working together seamlessly to deliver a comprehensive and efficient solution.
- In the realm of microservices, each component takes on a narrow domain of responsibility and is deployed independently of the others.
  It is crucial for microservices to handle the responsibilities of a singular part within a business domain.
- Microservices adhere to a set of fundamental principles for communication,
  utilizing **lightweight communication** protocols like HTTP and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to exchange data between the service consumer and the service provider.
- Microservices are designed in a way that the underlying technical details of the service become unimportant.
  This is because applications communicate using a technology-agnostic protocol, with JSON being the most commonly used.
  As a result, an application built using microservices can be crafted using **multiple languages and technologies** without any constraints.
- The small, autonomous, and decentralized nature of microservices enables organizations to form compact development teams with clearly defined responsibilities.
  These teams may collaborate on a common objective, like delivering an application, but each team is solely accountable for the services they are working on.


## Benefits of Microservice
###  Improved Scalability
Microservices allow independent scaling of individual services, enabling you to allocate resources precisely where needed and handle varying workloads efficiently.
### Fault Isolation
With each service being independent and deployable on its own, development teams can work concurrently, promoting faster development cycles and greater adaptability to changing requirements.
### Continuous Delivery
Smaller, independent services can be deployed more frequently, enabling continuous delivery and quicker updates to meet business demands.
### Fault Tolerance
Since failures are isolated to individual services, the overall system becomes more resilient, making it easier to recover from issues.
### Business Alignment
Microservices align well with domain-driven design, making it easier to model and represent business processes more accurately.
### Cloud Native
Microservices can be effortlessly deployed and hosted on cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, leveraging the power of cloud technology.
This allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and accessibility, enabling seamless management and efficient utilization of resources.
